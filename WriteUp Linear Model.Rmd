```{r setup, include=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
data <- read.csv(file="https://onlinestatbook.com/case_studies_rvls/physical_strength/data.txt",sep="",header=TRUE) 
```

###Plot scatterplot

```{r}
plot(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```

SIMS is on the y-axis and ARM is on the x-axis. This plot shows a positive linear correlation. The SIMS increase as does the size of the ARM.

##Now with ggplot - first select the basic data

```{r}
basicNN <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=ARM))
```
```{r}
basicNN + geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
